You never thought to kill, or fight for revenge. 
Only to test your limits, and to push yourself beyond them, to become the strongest you could possibly be. 
How can a Saiyan fight like that, and at the same time be so gentle that he wouldn't hurt a fly? 
It makes me angry just thinking about it. 
But perhaps it is my anger that has made me blind to the truth for so long. 
I see it now. 
This day has made it all too clear. 
You're better than me, Kakarot. 
You are the best...
